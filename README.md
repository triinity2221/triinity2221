- 👋 Hi, I’m @triinity2221
- 👀 I’m interested in having a deeper conversation with the data to understand what are its interests and purpose
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to articulate my findings with the data and also improve my tool bag with the latest data analytical approaches to give data the love (or hate) it deserves
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most of the data science projects involving NLP, Computer Vision, Speech recognition basically want to breakdown how I work through a small attempt to replicate it
- 📫 You can reach me out on rahulvpoojar1@gmail.com or on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvpoojari/
